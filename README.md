# STUIAdditions

This is a library of tools to be used in conjunction with STUI that will be
 maintained by observers, primarily for SDSS-V usage. Files and documentation
 can be tracked on confluence at
 https://wiki.sdss.org/display/APO/Observing+Scripts. This repository is based
 on the svn repository
 https://svn.sdss.org/repo/operations/apo/Scripts/APO-local
 
### Moderators

### Authors
In additions to the moderators who maintain this repo, contributions were made

## Structure
Files that are under development should be stored under Scripts/dev. Once they
 are ready for use, move them to Scripts.
 
## Code guidelines
All scripts should follow SDSS Coding Standards found at
 https://sdss-python-template.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standards.html, with some
 exceptions. Code should try to use camelCase. A main function is unnecessary.

## TODO
- This repository will see many more contributions once a viable test version of
 STUI on Python 3 is ready.
 
## License
STUIAdditions is licensed under a 3-clause BSD style license - see the
