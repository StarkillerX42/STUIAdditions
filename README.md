# STUIAdditions

By Dylan Gatlin

This is a repository of my development STUI Scripts. It is not connected with
 the live STUIAdditions library, but once a script is stable, it will be sent
 there to the observing team

## Notable Inclusions

### LogSupport3

This is the development version of LogSupport which is meant to have callbacks
 on dither sequences and well-formatted tables.

### guide_monitor_2

This is a unique script designed to bypass the need for the builtin guide
 monitor, scale monitor, and focus monitor. The script is designed to be less
 busy than the builtin guide monitor

### garbage_collector

In an attempt to clean STUI's memory leak, I began working with the garbage
 collector. It does not work.
